Employee Performance Analysis
INX Future Inc. (INX) is a prominent provider of data analytics and automation solutions with a global presence spanning over 15 years. Renowned for its employee-friendly human resource policies, INX has consistently ranked among the top 20 best employers for the past five years.

However, recent trends indicate declining employee performance indexes, posing a growing concern for top management. Escalations in service delivery have increased, and client satisfaction levels have dropped by 8 percentage points.

CEO, Mr. Brain, is aware of these issues but is hesitant to penalize non-performing employees due to potential negative impacts on overall employee morale. Additionally, maintaining the company's reputation as a top employer is crucial for attracting the best talent.

To address these challenges, Mr. Brain has initiated a data science project aimed at analyzing current employee data to uncover the underlying causes of performance issues. As a data scientist himself, Mr. Brain expects the project's findings to guide informed decision-making and identify non-performing employees in a way that minimizes negative impacts on employee morale.
